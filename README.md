# Face-Recognition-System


The Face Recognition System is a Python-based application designed to detect and recognize human faces from uploaded images or live webcam input. It uses OpenCV for face detection, the face_recognition library for feature extraction and matching, and Streamlit to provide a simple and interactive user interface.

The system works by first extracting and encoding facial features from known images and storing them as reference data. When a new face is captured through an image or webcam, the system generates its facial encoding and compares it with the stored encodings using Euclidean distance to find the closest match. If a match is found within a defined threshold, the person is identified accurately.

The application supports both image-based recognition and real-time webcam recognition, making it flexible and user-friendly. Due to its accuracy and real-time processing capability, the project can be effectively used in attendance management systems, user authentication, and security and surveillance applications.

Overall, this project demonstrates the practical implementation of computer vision and machine learning concepts in building a real-world face recognition solution.
